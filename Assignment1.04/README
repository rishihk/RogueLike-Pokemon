Explanation:

        We have now come to the stage where we add the NPC's or the trainers to our maps. I have added 6 kinds of NPC's namely,

        • Hikers: These will be represented by the letter ’h’. Hikers path to the PC by following a maximum
          gradient on the hiker map.

        • Rivals: These will be represented by the letter ’r’. Rivals path to the PC by following a maximum
        gradient on the rival map.

        • Pacers: These will be represented by the letter ’p’. Pacers start with a direction and walk until they
        hit some terrain they cannot traverse, then they turn around and repeat, pacing back and forth.

        • Wanderers: These will be represented by the letter ’w’. Wanderers never leave the terrain region they
        were spawned in. They have a direction and walk strait ahead to the edge of the terrain, whereupon
        they turn in a random direction and repeat.

        • Sentries: These will be represented by the letter ’s’. Sentries don’t move; they just wait for the action
        to come to them.

        • Explorers: These will be represented by the letter ’e’. Explorers move like wanderers, but they cross
        terrain type boundaries, only changing to a new, random direction when they reach an impassable
        terrain element.

        I have also added a switch, --numtrainers that takes an integer count of the number of trainers to scatter around. 

Usage:

    Run the make command in the directory and then a ./trainer to execute the output file
    Alternatively you can run the make run command in the directory to automatically see the output.
    Additionally, after running make, you can do ./trainers --numtrainers <integer> to set the number of trainers as you wish.
