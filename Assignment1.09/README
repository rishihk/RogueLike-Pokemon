## Explanation:

    In this version of the game we implement the minigame features turn-based battles between the PC and trainer pokemons or wild pokemons.

    # Battle Mechanics
    - Turn-Based Combat: Players and NPCs take turns to perform actions.
    - Simplified Mechanics: No status effects or Pokemon abilities are implemented.
    - Prioritization: Non-move actions have maximum priority.
    - Damage Calculation: Simplified to exclude status effects.
    - STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus): Implemented based on Pokemon and move types.
    - Critical Hits: Simplified calculation based on the Pokemon's base speed.

    # Battle Options
    - Fight: Use a Pokemon move.
    - Bag: Access items like revives, potions, and Pokeballs.
    - Run: Attempt to flee (only in wild Pokemon battles).
    - Pokemon: Switch active Pokemon.

    # Inventory Management
    - Revives: Revive knocked-out Pokemon to half max HP.
    - Potions: Restore up to 20 HP without exceeding max HP.
    - Pokeballs: Capture wild Pokemon (automatic success if PC has less than 6 Pokemon).

    # AI
    - NPC Behavior: Random move selection; Pokemon switching upon knockout.

    # Health and Restoration
    - Healing: Pokemon do not auto-heal post-battle. Healing is done via items or at Pokemon Centers.
    - Supply Restoration: Restock at PokeMarts or through the 'B' command outside of battles.

## Usage:

    Run make in the directory after extracting the tarball. Then run ./poke327 to execute the output file.
